Three types of errors - 
1. Syntax errors
2. Runtime errors
3. Logical Errors


How to find the errors and fix each of them - 

1. Syntax Errors -  Ide and compiler will throw this error so it is easy to find.
    

2. Runtime errors - Errors are thrown at runtime, so bit hard to detect intially.

3. Logical Errors - No error will be thrown and but app will behave unexpectedly. 
                    So we have to use debugging tools like run in debug mode to detect the errors.
